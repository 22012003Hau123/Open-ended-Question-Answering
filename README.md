# Open-ended-Question-Answering

This repository contains code and documentation for the Project 02 on Question Answering, a part of the course "Text Data Mining and Applications" at Ho Chi Minh City University of Natural Sciences.
## Introduction

This project focuses on building and evaluating Question Answering models using advanced NLP techniques. We explore the use of SqueezeBERT and ELECTRA models from Hugging Face's Transformers library for this task.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We first perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's distribution, data preprocessing, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and involves QA pairs.

## Testing with SimpleTransformers

We utilize SimpleTransformers framework to fine-tune and evaluate SqueezeBERT and ELECTRA models on our QA dataset. Configuration settings and results are detailed in the respective sections.
